        <h3>Definition (memorise)</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Colonial administration</strong> is the system used by European powers to govern African colonies
          after partition, mainly to maintain control and enable exploitation of resources.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Indirect Rule</strong> (mainly British; also used by Germans, Dutch, Italians in some areas)</li>
          <li><strong>Direct Rule</strong> (used where settlers were many or Africans resisted strongly)</li>
          <li><strong>Assimilation</strong> (mainly French; also used by Belgians & Portuguese)</li>
          <li><strong>Association</strong> (French adjustment when assimilation proved impractical)</li>

        <summary id="indirect-rule-meaning">Indirect Rule: Meaning</summary>
        <p>
          A system where African traditional rulers (chiefs) were used to administer Africans
          under the supervision and instructions of British officials.
        </p>

        <summary id="why-british-used-indirect-rule">Why the British used Indirect Rule</summary>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Cost saving:</strong> Britain had limited funds for colonial administration.</li>
          <li><strong>Shortage of manpower:</strong> few Europeans wanted to work in tropical Africa (disease/hardship fears).</li>
          <li><strong>Reduce resistance:</strong> made Africans feel their leaders still had power.</li>
          <li><strong>Past success:</strong> had worked in places like India and Uganda, encouraging use elsewhere.</li>
          <li><strong>Administrative realities:</strong> easier where centralized leadership already existed.</li>
